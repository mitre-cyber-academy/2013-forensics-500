I'm proud of you! You successfully got through this one. This challenge is
supposed to teach you that it's possible to hide information in subtle 
ways, like the width of a character like 'O'. I'm pretty impressed
with your ability to find MCA-3F1221C5 despite the tortuous O's. Did you 
use the blue channel?
